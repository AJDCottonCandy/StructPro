Information
--------------------------------
Adds new functionality to the world generator. It automatically spawns various structures based on schematics during world generation on the server side. It works both with server and client-integrated server. Strutures can reach gigantic proportions and generates as quickly as possible. During the world exploration you can discover neatly pasted schematics that looks harmonically with environment. Any user can add arbitrary schematic to make it possible automatically appear in the world. Collected more than 2900+ great schematics and include them to standard mod releases. Mod config provides the ability to adjust spawn rates. There is possibility to generate villages constructed from schematic sets.

Details
--------------------------------
First time launching this mod with 3000 schematics consumes about 1-5 min in forge loading screen, because of reading new schematic entails appropriate calculating dump files to speed up pasting routine in future. If your schematic have ground level with grass, gravel, stone, dirt etc. it will dig down as it is necessary. if your scheme made roughly, paste process will automatically detect air outside of your structure and place it goodly. Creatures automatically spawns inside buildings. For example blazes and ghasts in nether, villagers in village, cave spiders in undergrounds. Every chest have random loot according to configuration and may reproduce some schematic-native items. I spent many time to identify the best approach of the problem of the most beautiful schematic insertion in the world. I realize that schematic cosmetic-configuring is very time-expensive, so I decide to entrust this job to computer. I figured out many ennobling approaches and sewed it all to the mod.

Features:
Arbitrary schematics supported
Compact village generation
Available all possible types of buildings: Common, Underground, Underwater, Afloat, Sky, Hill
Accurate pasting and position calculation with several nearby attempts
Handling any inconvenience things that may happen
Automatic schematic parsing and biome determination
Keep tile entities like in schematic (Text signs, Command blocks, Spawners, Chests, etc)
Random chest loot
Random mobs spawn-control
Automatic mob-population inside generated structures
Flexible configuration of entire generation processes
In-game creative commands to paste schematics or even villages
Any players can combine their own schematic sets
Built-in schematic rotation and flipping algorithms
Lots of best schematics collected and it number over 2900
Compatible with most mods
No dependencies

Differences
--------------------------------
Differences with Placemod:
Major changes in logic system
Fixed most bugs
Fixed critical bug when overlapping blocks had not removed tile entities
Much more accurate soil-roughness calculations
Spawn attempts order to surely spawn some type of building if it possible
Universal world-cache system for fast and more simple world control
Convenient spawn commands for schematic and village
Isolated dump-files
Biome spawn relations improvements
Workable Command block, Text Signs, Dispensers, Chests, etc
Random chest loot for all versions

Limitations
--------------------------------
Schematic proportions W <= 1024, H <= 256, L <= 1024
Schematic volume <= 256^3
Schematic file size <= 16 MB
Java: 1.6+

Schematics
--------------------------------
You can find all .schematic inside schematics folder that you have to put inside your .minecraft root directory.
By default it has next subdirectories: Common, Floating, Underground, Underwater, Water, Village.
Saves goes into subdirectory with name Saves and they exluded from world generation but available for commands.
Put your own folders and schematics inside base folder without any problems.

Important folder names:
[Common] Conventional buildings
[Sky | Floating] hovering in the sky, like floating islands
[Underground] Fully dug into the ground
[Underwater] Appears under water
[Afloat | Water] Spawns exactly on water
[Village] Same folder schematics tries to appear all at once as village
[Hill | Mountain] Spawns like basic buildings but without roughness-accuracy bias.

You can add your schematics to any sub-folder of %appdata%/.minecraft/schematics/Your_Schematics, or the folder you specified in config.
Biomes determines automatically and fully isolated from players and builders.
You can set biome manually, just make sure schematic relative path have folder that is one of next:
Sand - SAND BIOME
Desert - SAND BIOME
Snow - SNOW BIOME
Ice - SNOW BIOME   
Cold - SNOW BIOME
Water - WATER BIOME
End - THE END BIOME
Mesa - MESA BIOME
Mushroom - MUSHROOM BIOME
Nether - NETHER BIOME
Hell - NETHER BIOME

REPLACE_BLOCKS {Map} [BlockSrc -> BlockDst, Comma separated, Case non-sensitive] Replaces blocks to another
EXCLUDE_ITEMS {Set} [Item names, Comma separated, Case non-sensitive] Exclude items from possible loot

Notice: To match any item or block that have some subword use .* around, for instance .*COMMAND.* to specify all command blocks/items
Notice: REPLACE_BLOCKS AND EXCLUDE_ITEMS support java regular expressions, for example .*COMMAND.* to find all words with command
Notice: To not spawn Structures, Villages, Items set DENSITY, DENSITY_VILLAGE, CHEST_LOOT_CHANCE = 0
Notice: To not spawn command blocks or other blocks add appropriate block name to BAN_BLOCKS
Notice: SPAWN_DIMENSIONS and VILLAGE_DIMENSIONS works both for names and ids and they are case sensitive
Notice: To allow items from other mods set ONLY_VANILLA_LOOT = false

FAQ
--------------------------------
- Are you using any dependencies to spawn structures in the world?
- Structpro are fully independent

- Where does the schematic folder go?
- .minecraft/schematics/ by default, but you can configure it

- For using own schematics, do we also need something?
- Nope, you need to put your schematics in the folder. Nothing more.

- How to make structures more rare?
- Go to config and open structpro.cfg file then put density, for instance 10 times less than before (0.005 -> 0.0005)

Sometimes creative command "paste" may produce structures with invisible mobs

Suggestions
----------------------------------------------
Request: Forge logo screen showing loading progress
Answer: Probably, when forge will provide ability to do it

Request: Support recurrent schematics
Answer: I'll see what can be done

Request: Schematica ghost image in the world
Answer: Use schematica with structpro and execute paste command on schematic ghost

Request: Insert default schematics into jar
Answer: Can't do it due some inconveniences in jar-file flow system

Request: Auto spawning mob-spawners inside already generated structures
Answer: It's badly correlated with mod logic, put spawners you need in your schematics

Installation
----------------------------------------------
Put downloaded jar to your minecraft mods folder
Download and unzip schematics to %appdata%/.minecraft/schematics (or schematics folder you specified in config)

Schematic sets
----------------------------------------------
You can suggest your own schematic-sets.
Useful tools:
[Online Schematic Viewer Cubical-XYZ]
[MC-EDIT V-1.0]
[Minecraft ForgeMod World-Edit]
Don't forget to save original name and prefix schematic author or publisher in square brackets.
